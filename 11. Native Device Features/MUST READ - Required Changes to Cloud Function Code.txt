MUST READ: Required Changes to Cloud Function Code
What do you need to do?

Replace the content of your functions/index.js  file with the content of the file attached to this and the last lecture (pick either of the two, they contain the same content).

Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID  with, well, your Firebase project id. Also make sure to replace the VAPID details in the code with the ones generated by you.

Run npm install --save busboy  inside the functions/  folder (i.e. cd functions  first).

You can now also uninstall formidable (npm uninstall --save formidable).

Additionally, edit your package.json file (in the functions folder) like this:

"@google-cloud/storage": "WHATEVER VERSION YOU HAVE HERE",
should become

"@google-cloud/storage": "1.7.0",
Thereafter, re-run npm install .

OR

You simply install that version of @google-cloud/storage right from the start => npm install --save @google-cloud/storage@1.7

That's it!

Why?

Firebase cloud functions received a breaking change that impacts how we parse request data. Therefore, Formidable doesn't work anymore.

See the following thread for more infos: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47242340/how-to-upload-a-file-using-express-on-firebase-cloud-functions

We'll use the workaround explained there. Attached to the last and this lecture, you find the updated function code - no changes to other files (e.g. service worker etc.) are required!

What changed in the cloud function code?

Firebase parses the request body for us and turns it into a Buffer (that's what changed - previously, it didn't parse it for us).

Hence we now use a different library - busboy  - to read the data from that Buffer. All the other code (e.g. upload file to bucket, store data in database) still is the same as shown in the video.

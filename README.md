# Progressive Web Apps (PWA) - The Complete Guide [Video]
Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are the next big thing in web development as they bring mobile-app-like experiences to your users without requiring them to install an app from the App store/ Play store.You still create a web application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) but this course will teach you how to add features such as camera access, service workers for offline support, push notifications, and more. This combines the best of both worlds: You deliver fast, engaging and reliable experiences whilst still having the reach and accessibility of a web page. "Progressive Web App" is simply a term that summarizes all the features that allow you to deliver mobile-like experiences. The topic is highly trending and it also is a topic which is here to stay! Not only is it strongly promoted by Google (actually a lot of talks at Google I/O 2017, Google's developer conference, were devoted to PWAs), it's also quickly being adopted by big companies like Twitter or the Washington Post. Having the skills to build and optimize these kind of web apps is already an important and highly demanded skill for modern web developers, a trend which is only going to accelerate! Therefore, learning how to build PWAs will give you a competitive edge! To ensure that you can apply the knowledge to ANY of your projects, the course project doesn't assume any JavaScript framework but focuses on the core features mentioned above!
